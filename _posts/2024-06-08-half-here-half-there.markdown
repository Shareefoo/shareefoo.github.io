<b>The 8th of June, 2024</b> - a day that I won't forget for quite some time as it was very stressful, confusing and contradicting in every way.

245 days since the start of the War on Gaza, and being abroad makes this much harder as my family is still there, I've lived in Gaza for my whole life until 2021 when I decided to leave Gaza and live abroad for the first time.

I was invited to a relative birthday party that day, although I haven't been socializing much recently because honestly you can't be normal and act like nothing is happening while this war is killing everyone who you know but that day I though it might be a good idea to change the mood a little bit especially since it was my little cousin 'Dominica' birthday, she turned 6! and I can't say no to her.

On the road and before reaching the party, I was checking the news as usual, and saw that a big operation was going on in Nuseirat Camp where my family are (this is probably the 7th time they moved to a different area because no where is safe in Gaza!)

and what happens when there's an operation going on and heavy bombing in one area ? you can't reach anyone!
