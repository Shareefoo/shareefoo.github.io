### The 10,000 steps a day cult

We've all heard and read about the importance of walking **10,000 steps a day** to stay healthy, and while it's not a rule of thumb or a strict science to walk 10,000 steps a day and you can even find a lot of controversy about this topic on the internet, we can safely assume that walking a certain amount of steps each day will definitely help in this time and age of computers and phones where we tend to sit almost all day and not move!

**So how can we improve our health in the age of technology using the technology itself ?**

\
Most of us usually add an item to their daily to-do list like (Walk 10,000 steps) and mark it as done at the end of the day when we've achieved that but sometimes we forget to check that item of the list or maybe we even forget to check how many steps we've walked today because this requires us to intentionally open our pedometer or steps tracking app thus putting an effort and remembering to do that every single day. but we can fix this using a very simple technique.

This simple technique that I did and you can do to improve your cardiovascular health and walk more is using the science of **"cueing"** or **"triggering"**.

In psychology and behavioral science, this phenomenon relates to how environmental cues around you prompt specific behaviors or actions. for example in our case, seeing a widget on your phone main screen reminding you to walk more and move around will trigger the behavior of getting 10,000 steps a day.

Over the years I've used many phones mainly Android phones with many different custom setups which is one of the reasons I prefer Android phones more than iPhones, the customizability is on another level but that's a topic for another day, also I've always had some health and fitness apps to record my activity levels and track my workouts but one main constant was the Samsung Health app since I used Samsung phones the most.

and while these apps tracked my steps everyday in the background I didn't pay much attention to how much I walked in a specific day since you need to actively open the app to check that but one day I thought maybe I should put a steps counter widget on my main screen so it'll be the first thing I see when I use my phone and this way I applied the science of **"cueing"** to remind me how much I was active that day.

### 2018: First Use of a Steps Counter Widget

The year was 2018, the first time I put a steps counter on my home screen, looking at this now, I've to admit, my home screen wasn't looking clean or minimalistic especially with that Google Search widget, I like to have my first and main screen as simple as possible but that will improve later as you'll see :)

### 2019: Fitting the System

Fast forward one year later and a couple of apps updates, you can see first, that I improved my home screen setup so that the steps counter widget will fit nicely there and don't obstruct anything and also that I became better at completing my 10,000 steps.

**Note:** I know that this is only one day, I can't put a screenshot for every single day but believe me, **this works!** especially when it's in front of your face each time you use your phone! you'll automatically become better at completing your daily steps and becoming a more active person.

### 2020: Sometimes you Fail and that's OK!

Now, did I walk 10,000 steps every single day ? of course not, you can't have a perfect day everyday and some days you just can't complete your daily goals or tasks, either because you get busy or life gets in the way which is perfectly normal but in this case, not getting my 10,000 steps didn't count as a goal completed in the Samsung App and I didn't get that sweet rewarding animation with the golden shoes in the widget so I had to adjust, I made the goal 6000 steps a day as I didn't have much time to walk and I wanted to be rewarded so 6000 it is which is still not bad as long as I'm being reminded to move my body.

_Adjusting the goal (2020)_


Another year passes, and after sticking to this system for more than 2 years, I can see that it became so easy for me to complete my daily 10,000 steps a day (I re-adjust back to 10k from 6k) and here we can see the power of "cuing" again, when I see that I didn't hit my daily goal, I just go for a walk, or instead of going to the nearest shop to buy groceries, I just go to another one that's a little bit far.

### What about Smartwatches or other wearable gadgets ? 

So far, we've only talked about how mobile phones can improve our health, and while most phones today come equipped with built-in sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and GPS technology, which form the foundation for measuring and calculating your movement and steps count, adopting new habits like walking 10,000 steps every day makes you think about how can you improve and refine this process, and when you try to improve this aspect of your life you will find that phones might not be very accurate at doing that, they're still pretty good and in most cases you'll fine with just only your phone but their accuracy might be off sometimes due to different factors like the direction your phone pointing at or where you put your phone, in a pocket or a bag and sometimes you walk a lot in one place like your home or the office but you don't really have your phone on you and it's just sitting on a table, but you want to add in theses steps to your daily total. in fact there are studies out there that shows this inaccuracy

 This study for example tried to verify the accuracy of smartphones apps for steps counting, comparing results from a medical-grade accelerometer worn on and it showed the apps overestimated the average daily step count of around 8,500 steps by close to 500 steps.[^1]

Again, your phone is fine for most cases and the accuracy will still be above 90% which is pretty good but if you want to go the extra mile, get more accurate measurements and know all the ins and outs of your activity level then you need a wearable gadget like a smart band or a smartwatch.

As a person who likes technology and electronic devices in general, getting a smartwatch seemed like a good idea and a reason for me get more active and stick to healthy habits, I saw this as a motivation.

At the time in 2021, the best thing that was available for me as a Samsung Galaxy phone owner was the Galaxy Watch Active 2, so I got that!

**Did I get better with the smartwatch ?**

If you're really interested in knowing and tracking your activity levels, getting a smartwatch can be a good investment and a good motivation for you to move more as it'll offer more features for you to explore.

another benefit of a smartwatch, you can go out for a run without taking your phone with you.


### The Result

What can we learn from this ? well, like I said in the title of this post, having a simple widget on your home screen will improve your health, it's not gonna change your life completely but you'll definitely feel good that you've achieved something today because let's be honest some days you might have a bad day where you didn't finish your other tasks so having this completed will make your day less bad.
