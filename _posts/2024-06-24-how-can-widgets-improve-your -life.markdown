We've all heard and read about the importance of walking 10,000 steps a day to stay healthy, although it's not a rule of thumb or a strict math to walk 10,000 steps a day and if you didn't your health will become worse but it definitely helps in this age of computers and phones where we tend to sit almost all day and not move!

So what have we done to apply this rule ? and how can we improve our health in the age of computers and phones using the phones themselves 

Most of us, add an item to the daily to-do list (Walk 10,000 steps) and mark it as done at the end of the day when we've achieved that.

Here's a simple trick I did and you can do to improve your health and walk more using the science of "cueing" or "triggering", in psychology and behavioral science, this phenomenon relates to how environmental cues around you prompt specific behaviors or actions. for example in our case, seeing a widget on your phone main screen reminding you to walk more and move around will trigger the behavior of getting 10,000 steps a day.

Over the years I've used many phones mainly Android phones with many different custom setups which is one of the reasons I prefer Android more than iPhones, the customizability is on another level, and I've always had some health and fitness apps to record activity levels and track my workouts but one main constant was the Samsung Health app since I used Samsung phones the most. 

and while these apps tracked my steps everyday in the background I didn't pay much attention to how much I walked in a specific day since you need to actively open the app to check that but one day I thought maybe I should put a steps counter widget on my main screen so it'll be the first thing I see when I use my phone and this way I applied the science of "cueing" to remind me how much I was active that day.

The year was 2018, the first time I put a steps counter on my home screen, looking at this now, I've to admit, my home screen wasn't looking clean or minimalistic especially with that Google Search widget but that will improve later as you'll see :)

Fast forward one year later and a couple of apps updates, you can see that I became better at completing my 10,000 steps

_Sticking to the goal (2019)_

Now, did I walk 10,000 steps every single day ? of course not, you can't have a perfect day everyday and some days you just can't complete your daily goals or tasks, either because you get busy or life gets in the way which is perfectly normal but in this case, not getting my 10,000 steps didn't count as a goal completed in the Samsung App and I didn't get that sweet rewarding animation with the golden shoes in the widget so I had to adjust, I made the goal 6000 steps a day as I didn't have much time to walk and I wanted to be rewarded so 6000 it is which is still not bad as long as I'm being reminded to move my body.

_Adjusting the goal (2020)_


Another year passes, and after sticking to this system for more than 2 years, I can see that it became so easy for me to complete my daily 10,000 steps a day (I re-adjust back to 10k from 6k) and here we can see the power of "cuing" again, when I see that I didn't hit my daily goal, I just go for a walk, or instead of going to the nearest shop to buy groceries, I just go to another one that's a little bit far.

What can we learn from this ? well, like I said in the title of this post, having a simple widget on your home screen will improve your health, it's not gonna change your life completely but you'll definitely feel good that you've achieved something today because let's be honest some days you might have a bad day where you didn't finish your other tasks so having this completed will make your day less bad.
