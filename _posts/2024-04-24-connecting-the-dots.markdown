<p><b>"Connecting the dots .."</b></p> 
The motto that I've chosen, which kinda describes me in some way, as a person who has many interests and a good base of information on a lot of subjects and I can talk with you about almot anything but at the same time I can't say I'm the best at one specifc thing so in some way I'm like Jack of all trades master of none. That's why I feel like this motto represents me and my path into improving and connecting a lot of different pieces together. and this can be perfectly described by this picture below:

_Knowledge vs Experience_

So I've been thinking about making a blog for god knows how long now!

I've only managed to take the first step, started writing some stuff and researching about the best way to publish the blog. but for some reason I never continued, and just switched to do something else and forgot about the whole thing for some time.

But the idea was still in the back of my head and it kept haunting me for quite some time until the moment that I read about something called Jekyll which is a "simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project or organization sites" 
I kept reading and I though this might be the moment where I stick to the idea of blogging using this tool, and there's a few reasons that got me interested in Jekyll specifically, becuase as many of us know, there are quite a few ways to make a blog such as:
<ul>
    <li>WordPress (probably the most popular)</li>
    <li>Blogger</li>
    <li>Wix</li> 
    <li>SquareSpace</li>
</ul>
and many others.

and the reasons why I liked Jekyll is first their philosophy which they described on their page and that philosophy goes by:
<blockquote>
    Jekyll does what you tell it to do â€” no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, Jekyll gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.
</blockquote>

The goal of this blog is to write about topics that interests me (there will be a few like I mentionted) mainly about Tech as I'm a Software Developer who worked as an Android Developer for some time, there'll be other posts about lifestyle, health, sports and video games! and and I hope that someone who share the same interest in one of the topics will find something useful here and maybe we can connect and share experiences!
