Paragraph

<h2>The birth of 'Connecting the dots ..' </h2>

<p>
The name that I've chose for my blog, i've been thinking about making a blog a god knows how long! 
I even took the first step, started writing some stuff and was reading about the besy way to publish the blog. but for some reason or another, I switched to do something else and forgot about the whole thing. the idea was still in the back of my head and it kept haunting me for quite some time until the moment that I read about Jekyll, it's a "simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project or organization sites"
